# Py2Art

A python random art generator

## Description

This python software is used to create a random 8x8 art piece using turtle and tkinter. The software chooses the color of each pixel randomly from a set library of colors that can be changed to your preference. It then generates the 64 total pixels to form your unique peice of art. The GUI has a simple and easy to use design to help you start creating as fast as possible. 

This software is not for commercial or academic use.
